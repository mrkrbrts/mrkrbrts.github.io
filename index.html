                <h1>My Coding Journey</h1>
                <hr class="small">
                
                <p>I've been learning how to code for about a year now. The languages I'm learning right now are CSS, HTML and JavaScript. Coding has been one of the most rewarding journeys I've been on, but it has been challenging (and even a bit frustrating) at times!</p>
                
                <div class="bar">
                    <p>When I was a kid, writing was my greatest passion - <span class="emphasis">my first love!</span></p> 
                </div>
                
                <p>My love for writing took many forms. One of my earliest works was a multi-media adaptation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Mythology" target="_blank">Age of Mythology</a> - a critically acclaimed video game at the time, but mostly forgotten when compared to its more popular cousin, and staple of the Real Time Strategy genre: Age of Empires.</p>
                <p>There are doubtlessly hundreds of thousands of words scattered across notepads, hard drives and blogs - verse and prose to profess my love, frustration, despair, and a lifelong fued with Mrs Woolfe in the style of a school hall panto - all lost to the passage of time.</p>
                <p>I went to study Creative Writing at Liverpool John Moores University - the first of my family to reach Higher Education, but my dad would have preferred that I studied a "proper subject". I lived a bohemian lifestyle with my best friends, and made some dodgy decisions. They were some of the best years of my life, and I wouldn't change a thing!</p>

                <div class="bar">
                    <p>But <span class="emphasis">I fell out of love with writing</span> in the process.</p>
                </div>
                
                <p>I still don't know what changed once I finished the course.</p>
                <p>Creative Writing is still part of my life, and probably will be until the day I die. I still enjoy critically thinking about other people's works, but at the moment I have the infamous Writer's Block - and for years I haven't been able to find a way around it.</p>

                <div class="bar">
                    <p><span class="emphasis">To be continued....</span></p>
                </div>
                
            </div>
