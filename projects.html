            <h2>Blackjack</h2>
            <p>An absolute classic: <strong>Blackjack</strong></p>
            <p>This was probably the first project I ever "completed" - although there are a lot of features I would like to add in the future (for example, a gambling mechanic, saving the game, nice animations), I am pretty proud with how far I developed my coding skills over a short period of time.</p>
            <p>Blackjack is one of the first projects of <a href="https://scrimba.com/" target="_blank">Scrimba's</a> Frontend Developer course - if you are interested in learning about coding, you should definately check out Scrimba. They have a wide range of courses available, and an active community with regular coding challenges and livestreams. Their enthusiasm for teaching people around the world is inspiring, I can't recommend them highly enough!</p>

            <h2>Snake</h2>
            <p>Snake!... Snake?... <strong>SNAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKE!</strong>!</p>
            <p>This is another project on Scrimba's Frontend Developer course. Working on Blackjack had a steady learning curve to it - while I was working on Snake, I realised I was picking up skills way quicker! It helped that I had more experience under my belt, and more comfortable with HTML and CSS than before, but I found that I was working <strong>way</strong> ahead of the course!</p>

            <h2>KlimbOut</h2>
            <p>My first developer gig!</p>
            <p>It's a long way from perfect, but it's still my first project for somebody else!</p>
            <p>KlimbOut was started by my friend, Sandrine, who I worked with at a youth charity in Manchester. We were part of the Careers & Enterprise offer, and Sandrine has decided to go solo and offer her services across Manchester. You can visit the site to learn more!</p>
            <p>To be honest, I found the CSS on this to be a bit of a f'kin nightmare (as you can probably tell if you visit the site). Flexbox makes a little bit of sense to me on a small scale, but when it's rolled out across an entire website with columns and images, and then you throw media queries into the mix!? My chances of understanding drastically go down.</p>
            <p>Still, it's a thing I made and I am going to continue working on it for the forseeable future. I'm not going to hide it, but I will probably leave it at the bottom of my Project page! Fair?</p>
